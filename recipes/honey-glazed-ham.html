        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This ham tastes very much like the famous honey baked ham but costs much less, and there's no need to fight the crowds at holiday time.</p>
        <p>You can even buy the ham presliced to make it easier and more like the original. It is very good.</p>
        <p>(I do this while preparing the rest of the meal in the kitchen so that I don't forget to baste!)</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>1 (5 pound) ready-to-eat ham</ul>
        <ul>1/4 cup whole cloves</ul>
        <ul>1/4 cup dark corn syrup</ul>
        <ul>2 cups honey</ul>
        <ul>2/3 cup butter</ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <ol>-Preheat oven to 325 degrees F(165 degreees C).</ol>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <ol>-Score ham, and stud with the whole cloves. Place ham in foil lined pan.</ol>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <ol>-In the top half of a double boiler, heat the corn syrup, honey and butter. Keep glaze <p>warm while baking ham.</p></ol>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <ol>-Brush glaze over ham, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven. <p>Baste ham every 10 to 15 minutes with the honey glaze.
