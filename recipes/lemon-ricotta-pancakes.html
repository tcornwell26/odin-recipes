    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If these pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate--and I didn't even separate the eggs and whip the whites.</p>
    <p>Also, I used water instead of milk--and I liked them better that way. I like to serve these with a pat of butter, a pinch of</p>
    <p>lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>3/4 cup cold water or milk</ul>
    <ul>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</ul>
    <ul>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon white sugar</ul>
    <ul>1 large egg</ul>
    <ul>1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons melted butter</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon lemon juice</ul>
    <ul>1 cup self-rising flour</ul>
    <ul>2 tablespoons self-rising flour</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <ol><p>-Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, lemon</p>
        <p>zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of</p> 
        <p>cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-</p>
        <p>rising flour. Whisk together, stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.</p></ol>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <ol>-Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</ol>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <ol><p>-Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion out</p> 
        <p>1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form</p> 
        <p>on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip</p> 
        <p>and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.</p></ol>
