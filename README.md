Project: Recipes
In this project, I have created a site with links to 3 recipes. To make this work I used different styles of headers, anchor tags to create relative links, unordered and ordered lists, images and paragraph tags to keep everything organized.

I made the mistake of saving images to my local computer and using those for my site. When published and the images did not populate the page, I fixed my mistake by using
absolute links to images online instead of relative links to images on my PC.
